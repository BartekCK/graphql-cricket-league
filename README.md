App contain simple access to _Indian Premier League_ data by **graphql queries**. The basement
of application is `Apollo Server` associated with `Express.js`. There was used `schema first` approach
during development process. Playground by apollo server is exposes because of presentation purposes. 

Inside .db folder you can find a csv files to fill tables by data. There were created special migrations
to automate this process (more in how to run). For finding the right match that you looked for, **trigrams** 
were implemented. There were created indexes (`pg_trgm` module) which associate in match table between columns:
venueName, cityName and hostCountry. This approach make easier finding match by location.

## How run local

1. Copy `.env.template` to `.env` in the same path.
2. Run `docker-compose up`

If you find problem with migration you can lunch it by yourself `npm run migration:up` or refresh server
to automatically execute migration commands. (Application sometimes try to run migrations commands before
full database initialization. To resolve it you can use upper approach or 
use https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it/master/wait-for-it.sh or increase timeout for 
database connection in app.)

## Useful queries

### Matches
#### Query
```graphql
query Matches($matchPlace: String!) {
  matches(matchPlace: $matchPlace) {
    cityName
    hostCountry
    venueName
    id
    matchDate
  }
}
```
#### Variables

Pay attention to value `ramchi`. There is an incorrect **cityName** because the correct
is `Ranchi` by **n** not **m**. Trigrams make job on this query and try to 
find the most
appropriate records for provided arguments.

```json
{
  "matchPlace": "ramchi"
}
```

#### Example Response
```
{
  "data": {
    "matches": [
      {
        "cityName": "Ranchi",
        "hostCountry": "India",
        "venueName": "JSCA International Stadium Complex",
        "id": 598062,
        "matchDate": "2013-05-12"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
